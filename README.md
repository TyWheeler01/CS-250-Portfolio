Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires us to understand the requirements and expectations of the user. Through techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observations; creating user stories is a key part of this process. This helps to break down user requirements into manageable segments that can guide the development process. User stories focus on the who, what, and why of a required feature or fundamental function. This helps developers to understand and prioritize whatâ€™s most important to the end user in order to deliver a better product. In approaching program development I aim to adopt agile processes such as Scrum. This methodology emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, which allows for continuous improvement to changing requirements. By incorporating agile processes into my work, I aim to increase efficiency, deliver higher-quality products, and better respond to user needs. Being a good team member in software development involves several key aspects. Communication is perhaps the most important aspect. The team and stakeholders need to be communicated with often and in an open and honest manner. This ensures everybody involved is informed on projects and kept up to date on progress. Collaboration is another significant part of being a good team member. The entire process of development is collaborative. Being willing to listen to others' ideas are important for creating a positive team dynamic and creating innovative solutions to complex problems that arise. Being adaptable and open to feedback is also essential for success.
